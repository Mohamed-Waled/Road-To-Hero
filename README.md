# Road to Hero

An online reading platform for serialized light novels. Chapters are retrieved straight from the novel's server using a Node.js-powered Discord bot, which arranges them in an orderly and easily navigable manner. Additionally, the website has a tracking feature that lets users easily keep tabs on their progress. Ideal for people who prefer a simplified reading experience with integrated progress monitoring!

## My process

## The idea

The main idea behind this site is to make reading the **Road to Hero** novel easier. This novel was originally published on a Discord server. The author opened a server, set up a channel, and started writing his novel. I found it hard to read and keep track of what I had finished, and every time I needed to scroll through a ton of messages to find where I had stopped. So, I got an idea: why not build a Discord bot that fetches the messages (i.e., story chapters) from the channel, organizes them by removing the white spaces, and arranges them in order? Then, I could build an API to GET these chapters and put them into this application, creating a better user experience with simple tracking functionality. VoilÃ ! An easier life for me and the readers of this novel!

> [!NOTE]
> The author of the novel is a friend of mine, so before I even started this project, I asked for his permission, and he granted it to me!
